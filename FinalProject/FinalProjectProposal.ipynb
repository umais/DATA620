        "**Analyzing the Evolution of Stock Market Correlations Using Network Visualization**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Project Overview**  \n",
        "The goal of this project is to analyze how stock market correlations evolve over time using network visualization techniques. We aim to track relationships between major companies or industries and how they strengthen or weaken during economic shifts.  \n",
        "\n",
        "By using animated network graphs and graph theory techniques (such as Minimum Spanning Trees), we can visualize market dynamics, particularly during financial crises, economic booms, or major global events (e.g., the 2008 crash, COVID-19 pandemic). We will also incorporate sentiment analysis from financial news sources to understand how media emotion (positive or negative) impacts market behavior and investor sentiment during these periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Motivation**  \n",
        "Financial markets are deeply interconnected, and correlations between stocks often shift due to macroeconomic conditions, investor psychology, or industry-specific events. Understanding these evolving patterns can provide insights for investors, policymakers, and economists.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We hypothesize that:  \n",
        "- During market crashes, stock correlations increase due to synchronized investor behavior (e.g., panic selling).  \n",
        "- During stable periods, stock correlations diversify, with more independence across sectors.  \n",
        "- Certain industries (e.g., tech, finance) maintain persistently strong correlations, while others (e.g., consumer goods) fluctuate.  \n",
        "- News sentiment may trigger or reinforce correlation patterns, as markets react to collective emotions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, by constructing a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of stock correlations, we can derive a simplified structure of market relationships to analyze market diversity and inform **systematic trading strategies**.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Guiding Question**  \n",
        "**\"How do stock correlations change over time, and what patterns emerge during financial downturns versus stable market periods?\"**  \n",
        "**Sub-question:** *How does financial news sentiment influence market structure and correlation strength?*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Data Sources**  \n",
        "We will utilize multiple sources including:  \n",
        "- **Yahoo Finance / Alpha Vantage / Kaggle**: Daily stock prices for S&P 500 companies  \n",
        "- **FRED**: Macroeconomic indicators (interest rates, inflation, GDP)  \n",
        "- **SEC Filings**: Company sector classifications  \n",
        "- **Financial News Datasets**: For sentiment analysis (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg, or Kaggle's financial news datasets)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Plan for Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Data Collection:**  \n",
        "- Stock price data (10–20 years)  \n",
        "- News articles and headlines for sentiment scoring  \n",
        "- Sector metadata for companies  \n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Data Cleaning & Processing:**  \n",
        "- Calculate rolling correlation matrices for defined time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly)  \n",
        "- Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to score financial news by sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)  \n",
        "- Tag news events to corresponding time windows for overlay analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Network Construction & Graph Theory Modeling:**  \n",
        "- **Nodes** = Companies  \n",
        "- **Edges** = Correlation strength (thresholded, e.g., >0.6)  \n",
        "- Build and visualize networks for each time period  \n",
        "- Construct **Minimum Spanning Trees** (MSTs) to observe core market structures  \n",
        "- Evaluate MST-based metrics (e.g., node centrality, tree diameter) for shifts in market cohesion  \n",
        "- Compare structures across high-sentiment vs. low-sentiment periods\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Visualization:**  \n",
        "- Use **NetworkX** in Python or **ndtv** in R for animated and interactive network graphs  \n",
        "- Color-code by industry (e.g., Tech = Blue, Finance = Green)  \n",
        "- Incorporate financial event markers and sentiment overlays  \n",
        "- Enable interactivity (e.g., hover to show ticker, sector, correlation score)\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Insights & Interpretation:**  \n",
        "- Identify patterns of correlation and cohesion before/during/after crises  \n",
        "- Assess sentiment-driven market behavior  \n",
        "- Derive implications for portfolio diversification and automated trading strategies\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Concerns & Challenges**  \n",
        "- **Data Availability:** Clean, long-term historical stock data and reliable financial news archives  \n",
        "- **Computational Complexity:** Correlation matrices and MST construction over long time series  \n",
        "- **Threshold Selection:** Deciding meaningful correlation cutoffs and sentiment intensity levels  \n",
        "- **Sentiment Accuracy:** Ensuring NLP sentiment scoring reflects actual market-moving tone\n",

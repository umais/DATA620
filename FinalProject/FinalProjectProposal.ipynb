        "#**Project Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to analyze how stock market correlations evolve over time using network visualization techniques. We aim to track relationships between major companies or industries and how they strengthen or weaken during economic shifts. By using animated network graphs, we can visualize market dynamics, particularly during financial crises, economic booms, or major global events (e.g., the 2008 crash, COVID-19 pandemic).\n",

        "#**Motivation**\n",
        "\n",
        "Financial markets are interconnected, and correlations between stocks often shift due to economic conditions, investor sentiment, or sector-specific trends. Understanding these shifts can provide insights for investors, policymakers, and economists. We hypothesize that:\n",
        "\n",
        "- During market crashes, stock correlations increase, as investors react uniformly (panic selling).\n",
        "\n",
        "- During stable periods, stock correlations diversify, as different industries perform independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Certain industries (e.g., tech, finance) maintain strong correlations, while others (e.g., consumer goods) fluctuate over time.\n",
        "\n",

        "\"How do stock correlations change over time, and what patterns emerge during financial downturns versus stable market periods?\"\n",

        "\n",
        "We will use historical stock price data from sources such as:\n",

        "- Yahoo Finance / Alpha Vantage / Kaggle datasets for daily stock prices\n",
        "\n",
        "- FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) for macroeconomic indicators\n",
